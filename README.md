# idm.log

Basic set of dependencies and configuration to get logging working. Custom
helper macros are provided in `idm.log`.

## Usage

Leiningen dependency:
```clojure
[edu.bard/idm.log "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

Clojure [tools.logging](https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging) is included
as a dependency; for the majority of operations, it should suffice:
```clojure
(ns some-ns
  (:require
     [clojure.tools.logging :as log]))
```

For special use cases, use the macros in `idm.log`; generally these are
referred by name, e.g.:
```clojure
(ns some-ns
  (:require
    [clojure.tools.logging :as log]
    [idm.log :refer [passf]]))
```

## Configuration
If you need to configure the underlying log engine (Log4j2), simply copy
[`log4j2.yml`](resources/log4j2.yml) into your classpath (i.e., `resources/`)
and make requisite changes - it will override the one provided here.
